    %p
      PorkChop Club began as a pure JavaScript scoreboard for helping us keep track
      of service in our table tennis matches at <a href="https://stembolt.com">Stembolt</a>.
      Named for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis#Chop">chop</a>
      shot and its use of <a href="https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/">Bacon.js</a>,
      it quickly evolved into a full fledged Rails application that tracks our
      game records, Elo ratings, and achievements.
